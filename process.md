# 1 Project goals and vision

## 1.1 Main Project goal

The goal of the Project is to provide a tool for monitoring of distributed applications in actor model in Akka framework. We begin with the short introduction to the basics, e.g. the actor model, messageÂ­passing semantics and practical problems with debugging distributed systems. Based on this introduction we define our problem precisely and describe in more details the tool that we will be creating.
